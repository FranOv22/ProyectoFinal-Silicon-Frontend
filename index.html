            <h2>MH World Features</h2>
            <ul class="mhfeats">
                <li><b>Living and breathing ecosystem:</b> Utilize the surrounding environment and wildlife to your advantage. For example, pit Monsters against one another to lure the main target creature to the right place, but be careful not to become hindered by the hazards they present.</li>
                <li><b>Global simultaneous release:</b> For the first time in the Monster Hunter series the latest title will release within the same launch window and unite hunters across the world with cross-region cooperative play options.</li>
                <li><b>Online drop-in Multiplayer:</b> When the battle is too daunting to take on single-handedly, hail up to three other hunters to assist during quests by sending up a SOS flare to a worldwide server full of potential teammates.</li>
                <li><b>Hunt to craft new gear:</b> Defeat monsters and collect loot from fallen foes to craft Armor and Weapons styled after the monsters that have been slain. Selecting the right loadout can help exploit enemy weaknesses to gain an advantage in battle.</li>
                <li><b>Master the beasts:</b> A variety of ferocious creatures inhabit the new world landscape including the series mainstay Rathalos and the all new Anjanath. Players can mount the monsters with the dynamic riding mechanic, allowing them to travel along the monster’s body and deliver locational damage.</li>
                <li><b>Seamless gameplay:</b> Players and monsters can move from one map Location to another freely and without loading screens whilst gameplay also dynamically transitions between night and day.</li>
